        <p class="govuk-body">If there is no way of serving (sending) the [divorce application / application to end your civil partnership] to your [husband / wife / civil partner] then you can apply to ‘dispense with service’. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If your application is successful then the court will allow your [divorce / application to end your civil partnership] to continue without ‘serving’ (sending) the application to your [husband / wife / civil partner]. </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          You will have to prove that there is no way of serving the divorce application to your husband, and that you have done everything in your power to find their contact details. 
          If you have any way of contacting them, then you should provide these details to the court instead and you should not apply for deemed service. For example if you have their mobile phone number, email address or social media profile then you should <a href="https://fpl-probate-prototypes.herokuapp.com/divorce/alternative_service_2/alternative_1">apply to serve by one of those ways</a>. 
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you are sure you cannot provide any details for them, then you can start the application to dispense with service. It costs £53, unless you are eligible for <a href="#0">Help With Fees</a>.</p>
