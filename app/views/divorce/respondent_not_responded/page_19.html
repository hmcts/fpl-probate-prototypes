        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          It can take several months to search government records. You should therefore only apply if you have no other way of sending the application to your husband or wife. 
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you have any contact details for them at all, then you should provide these to the court instead. For example, their mobile phone number, email address or social media profile. You can <a href="https://fpl-probate-prototypes.herokuapp.com/divorce/alternative_service_2/alternative_1">apply to serve them by one of these ways here</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you still want to apply to search government records, then it will cost an additional £53, unless you are eligible for Help With Fees. </p>
